                <p style="font-size:15px; color: #3B3B3B;">The concept of Exams4U has arrived at a time when run-of-the-mill websites are offering sub-standard, inflexible and<br /> over-priced services for conducting tests. Exams4U offers its clients a simple and a relaxed interface, hassle-free<br /> flow from one test process to the other.</p>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color: #3B3B3B;">Exams4u is the first fully customizable application that you can mould as per your requirements. We have a strong,<br /> multi-functional base software that we use as a primer to create the interface, and include/exclude the features<br /> you want in your Exams4U.</p>
